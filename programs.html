          <h1>Programs</h1> <br> <br>
          <p>We have two programs that trainees could participate. One is a <i>formal training</i> and the other one is a self-paced <i>personal learning.</i></p>
          <br><h2>Formal Training</h2> 
          <p>We offer selected IT courses on tuition basis. Most courses last three
            months on the basis of 2-hour classes being offered twice a week on
            different days. Some courses take up to nine months to complete.
            There are different levels of training in the subjects - beginner,
            intermediate, and advanced levels.</p>
          <br> <h2>Personal Learning</h2>
          <p>We consult those who are determined to learn IT personally because
            they do not have the opportunity to participate in formal IT trainings.
            There would be a minimal fee for the consultation.</p>
          <br> <h2>Who the program is for</h2>
          <p>This program is for anyone tech lover who does not have the
            opportunity to pursue formal college studies in IT. Our program is
            particularly beneficial to people with the following background, in a
            descending order:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>College graduates in IT, Math, Statistics, or Engineering,
              graduates who would like to add some specific additional IT
              skills or refresh those skills.</li>
            <li>College graduates in any subjects who would like to jump-start
              the IT profession.</li>
            <li>High school graduates and those who have some college study.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some low wage workers such as taxicab drivers could benefit much from this
            program since they can invest their call waiting time in IT learning. Home stay
            moms (or dads) could similarly benefit from the program since they can turn
            their extra time as they attend their infants or kids.</p>
            <br> <h2>Benefits of the Programs</h2>
            <p>Benefits from our programs range from enjoying a hobby, to sharpening of
              one’s mind, to job employment. An elderly trainee once said, “I would even
              consider this program to keep my mind sharp or make it sharper”. However, the
              extent to which a trainee or a learner can benefit varies depending on the
              individual trainee’s situation – e. g., education background, determination to
              learn, and amount of effort spent on learning.
              Our program would give a good knowledge and experience for those trainees
              who would want to attend other advanced trainings such as IT boot camps.</p>
